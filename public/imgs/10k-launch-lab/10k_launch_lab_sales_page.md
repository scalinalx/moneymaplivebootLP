# You Know WHAT to Do. But You Have No Idea WHERE to Start.

**Let me guess:**

You attended the workshop. You took notes. You downloaded the templates.

You were PUMPED.

**Then you sat down to actually write your sales page... and froze.**

Stared at the blank screen.

Thought: *"I'll figure this out tomorrow."*

Tomorrow became next week. Next week became next month.

**And 3 months later, you still haven't launched.**

---

### **Sound familiar?**

You're not alone.

**87% of people who attend workshops never implement what they learned.**

Not because the information wasn't good.

**Because knowing what to do and actually DOING it are two completely different skills.**

And that gap between knowledge and execution?

**That's where most newsletter creators fall.**

---

## **Here's What Happened to Marcus:**

Marcus attended my workshop in November.

He learned the framework. Took 11 pages of notes. Downloaded everything.

**Then he tried to implement... and got stuck.**

*"Where do I start?"*  
*"Should I write the sales page first or the emails?"*  
*"How do I set up Stripe again?"*  
*"What if I'm doing this wrong?"*

**He spent 3 months "figuring it out."**

Made $0.

---

**Then Marcus joined the 10K Launch Lab.**

**Day 1:** Open module → "Complete Offer Validation Worksheet" → 30 minutes → Done

**Day 7:** Sales page complete (used fill-in-the-blank template)

**Day 14:** 5-email sequence scheduled (used templates)

**Day 22:** Launched

**Day 27:** $5,200 in revenue

---

**Same Marcus.**  
**Same offer.**  
**Same audience.**

**The only difference?**

**He had a paint-by-numbers system that made it impossible to get lost.**

---

# That's What the 10K Launch Lab Is.

**It's not another course where you "watch videos and figure it out."**

It's a **30-day implementation system** where every single day has **ONE focused task**.

No guessing.  
No decision fatigue.  
No "I'll do this later."

**You open today's module. You do the task. You check the box.**

And in 30 days, you've launched your offer and made your first $5K-$10K.

**Or you know exactly what to fix for your next launch.**

---

## **✅ Here's Exactly What's Inside:**

### **🗓️ 30 Daily Action Plans** (30-60 min/day max)

## **💰 The Math You Need to See:**

### **Option A: "Figure It Out" On Your Own**

**Time investment:** 6 months of trial and error  
**Likely outcome:** $0-$2,000 (if you don't give up)  
**Cost:** $0 (but you lose 6 months)

**Lost revenue:** $60,000 (6 months of potential $10K you didn't make)

---

### **Option B: Hire It Out**

**Funnel builder:** $1,500  
**Copywriter:** $2,000  
**Launch consultant:** $2,500

**Total: $6,000**

**Time: 4-6 weeks** (coordinating with 3 people)  
**Control: 0%** (you're relying on others)

---

### **Option C: Join the 10K Launch Lab**

**Investment:** $597  
**Time:** 30 days (30-60 min/day)  
**Control:** 100% (you're building it, I'm guiding you)

**If you hit ONE $7K launch:** This pays for itself **12x over**

**Plus:** You now have the system to launch again and again

---

**Which option makes the most sense?**

---

## **🚨 COHORT STARTS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 9TH**

### **Why a cohort?**

Because everyone needs to be on the same 30-day timeline for the weekly calls to work.

**You start Day 1 together.**  
**You get feedback together.**  
**You launch together.**  
**You celebrate together.**

**Cohort size: 30 people maximum**

After that, enrollment closes until mid March.

---

## **⏰ ENROLLMENT CLOSES: FRIDAY, FEB 7TH AT 11:59 PM EST**

**After that:**

- Price goes back to $797  
- Next cohort doesn't start until April  
- You lose 2 months of revenue ($20K+)

## **✅ THE GUARANTEE: "Launch-or-We-Fix-It"**

**Here's my promise:**

**IF YOU:** ✅ Complete all 30 daily tasks  
✅ Attend at least 3 of the 4 weekly calls  
✅ Launch your offer within 45 days

**AND YOU DON'T MAKE AT LEAST $3,000...**

**I'LL PERSONALLY:**

3️⃣ Give you a custom recovery plan

**OR**

💰 **Refund your $597. No questions asked.**

---

**You can't lose if you do the work.**

---

## **❓ FAQ:**

### **"I don't have an offer yet. Can I still join?"**

YES. Day 1 is the Offer Validation Worksheet. By Day 2, you'll have your offer. That's the whole point.

---

### **"I'm not technical. Will I get stuck on the tech setup?"**

NO. Every tech step has a Loom video showing exactly where to click. Plus, Week 3's live call is entirely devoted to tech troubleshooting. You won't get stuck.

---

### **"What if I can't attend the live calls?"**

No problem. Recordings are posted within 2 hours. Plus, the Skool community gives you 24-hour async support. You can do this entirely self-paced if needed.

---

### **"I have a newborn/full-time job. Do I have time for this?"**

YES. Each daily task is 30-60 minutes MAX. Do it during naptime. Do it at 10 PM. Do it whenever. The program is async-first with one optional live call per week.

---

### **"What if I've already launched and it flopped?"**

PERFECT. The Disaster Recovery Playbook \+ relaunch strategies will show you exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. Several students have relaunched "failed" offers using this system and 5-10x'd their results.

---

### **"Is this a course or coaching?"**

BOTH. You get the course materials (daily tasks, templates, videos) AND weekly group coaching (hot seats \+ feedback). Best of both worlds.

---

### **"What happens after 30 days?"**

You keep lifetime access to all materials. You can relaunch as many times as you want using the same system.  
---

### **"What if I want 1-on-1 help?"**

I'm offering a limited number of **1-on-1 Strategy Calls ($500 for next 24 hours, normally $1,000)** for Launch Lab members who want private offer reviews. You'll get details inside Skool.

## **🎯 By March 12th, You'll Either Have:**

✅ Launched your offer  
✅ Made your first $5K-$10K  
✅ Validated what works  
✅ Built momentum for next launch  
✅ Proven to yourself you can do this

---

### **Option B:**

❌ Still "figuring it out"  
❌ Still sitting on your offer  
❌ Still watching other people make money  
❌ Still wondering "when will it be my turn?"

---

**Which option sounds better?**

[**Choose Option A \- Join the Lab →**](#)

---

## **💡 The Real Question:**

This isn't about the $597.

**This is about the next 30 days of your life.**

Do you want to spend them:

**Path A:** Trying to "figure it out" on your own, getting stuck, giving up

Or

**Path B:** Following a proven system, getting support, actually launching

---

**Both paths cost you 30 days.**

**Only one path makes you money.**

---

## **🔥 FINAL THOUGHT:**

6 months from now, you'll either think:

*"I'm so glad I joined. I actually launched. I made money. This changed everything."*

Or

*"I really wish I'd joined. I'm still stuck where I was in February."*

**One of those futures is about to happen.**

**You choose which one.**

**Right now.**
