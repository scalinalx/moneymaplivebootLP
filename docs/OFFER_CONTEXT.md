# Offer Context: Build to Profit + Money Map (Marketing Brief)

This brief captures the positioning, pricing, timing, and messaging to market both offers clearly and consistently.

## Products and Positioning

- Build to Profit (BTP)
  - What it is: Live, cohort-style implementation program with coaching and feedback.
  - What it includes: An exact 12‑day launch plan and live sessions to ship your offer and make sales (first cohort Nov 18–19).
  - What it solves: The implementation gap — turning your perfected offer into a real launch that drives revenue, LTV, retention, and brand growth.

- Money Map (MM)
  - What it is: The complete strategy system — ICP, offer building, positioning, market segmentation, messaging, copywriting.
  - What it includes: 5 modules, 10+ hours of workshop recordings, 50+ templates and frameworks, tools and community; lifetime access.
  - What it solves: Strategic clarity and the “perfect offer” you’ll implement in BTP.

- How they fit together
  - MM = Strategy foundation. BTP = Implementation and momentum.
  - Recommended path: Bundle both for best outcomes
  - You can do BTP without MM but you'll get mediocre results at best. For best results we recommend getting the bundle. 
  - #1 newsletter monetization community: 300+ members scaling newsletters to $10K–$100K+. Live workshops, systems, boost sessions. Turn expertise to revenue.

## Why Bundle Money Map with Build to Profit

- Strategy first, execution second: Money Map builds your ICP, offer, positioning, segmentation, messaging, and copy — the exact inputs Build to Profit assumes so the 12‑day launch plan can move fast and hit hard.
- Launch the right offer: Without MM, you risk executing BTP on a weak or mismatched offer. With MM, you arrive Nov 18–19 with a refined “perfect offer” ready to ship.
- Higher conversion, more revenue: Sharper positioning + message‑market fit = more sales, higher LTV, and better retention. BTP’s sequences work best when MM’s strategy work is done.
- Avoid costly mistakes: MM prevents classic traps (wrong audience, wrong price, vague promise, weak messaging) that make launches underperform.
- Faster outcomes: Do the MM pre‑work, then use BTP to implement in 12 days. No guessing in‑session — just decisive execution and momentum.
- Reusable assets: MM’s frameworks and templates become long‑term assets for future launches, upsells, and renewals.
- Confidence + accountability: Clarity from MM means you use BTP’s live coaching to optimize — not to figure out fundamentals on the fly.
- Best‑value path: If you haven’t bought MM, get the Bundle — Build to Profit + Money Map for $747 (Money Map at 50% off; instead of $994 total).
- Who should definitely bundle: New to monetization, pivoting offers, or struggling with conversions — MM tightens strategy so BTP can maximize results.
- Bottom line: You can buy BTP standalone, but the fastest, safest path to sales is Strategy (Money Map) + Implementation (Build to Profit) together.
